### What data does **XETA** collect ?

As there is not much functionality to the bot yet, we do not really need to store any actual data.
We only store one basic thing to make sure that everything functions properly.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose | Commands |
| :------------- | :----------: | :----------: |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings settings. | 24/7 |

### Do we share our collected data with anyone ?

We do **NOT** share any of our user data, since we know how important privacy is for every one of us.

### I want to delete all my data, how am I able to do it ?

There are 3 main options available to delete your data.
- You can either contact the developer on Discord [BxBY ðŸ–¤#5310](https://discordapp.com/users/936577273526644736) providing your User ID / Server ID. Once the developer is online, your data will be deleted as soon as possible!
- Join our Discord __[Support Server](https://discord.gg/Y9gAdW8rvV)__ by using the `support` command, go to `#general` and mention your current state and issue.
- Some of the settings already have an option to disable them/delete the stored data. If there is no option available, try the first 2 options mentioned above.
